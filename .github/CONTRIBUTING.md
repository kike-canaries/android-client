Welcome
-------

We invite you to join our team! Everyone is welcome to contribute code
via pull requests, to file issues on GitHub, to help people asking for
help on our mailing lists, our chat channels, or on Stack Overflow, to
help triage, reproduce, or fix bugs that people have filed, to add to our
documentation, or to help out in any other way.

We communicate primarily over GitHub.

Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
