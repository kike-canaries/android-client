# CanAirIO Air quality Reporter

[CanAirIO](https://canair.io) is a citizen science initiative for air quality tracking, visualization and dissemination by using PM2.5 particulate material sensors paired with your smartphone via bluetooth.

This code is for [CanAir.io](https://canair.io) Android app that using a [DIY device](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_firmware#canairio-firmware) that handle a pollution sensor (Honeywell, Sensirion, Plantower, Panasonic) or others air quality sensors.

# Installation

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hpsaturn.pollutionreporter" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kike-canaries/android-hpma115s0/master/assets/googleplay/gplayicon.png" align="right" width="128" ></a>

You can install it from the [release section](https://github.com/kike-canaries/esp32-hpma115s0/releases) downloading the last signed apk or installing from [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hpsaturn.pollutionreporter)

# Building

## Dependencies

- Android SDK
- CMake

## Requirements

Please first clone the project with all submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_android.git
```

### Firebase

This application uses a Firebase Database instance to store mobile air quality reports, 

For local development, you will need to create a database in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) using `hpsaturn.pollutionreporter` as the application identifier and retrieve a `google-services.json` file. See instructions [here](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en).

After that copy this file into the project:

```bash
cd canairio_android && cp ~/google-services.json app/
```

### AQICN API key (optional)

Please put your Aqicn API key in `app/src/main/res/values/api_aqicn.xml` or create a fake file like with:

``` xml
<resources>
    <string name="api_aqicn_key">7cbbbb864b9c0755b8xxxxyyy</string>
</resources>
```

## Compiling

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

# Usage

For now you need any Android device with Bluetooth 4 or above. You can download the CanAirIO app from [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hpsaturn.pollutionreporter), keep in mind that it is in continuos development then please any feedback, report errors, or any thing please let us knowed it via our [contact form](http://canair.io/#three) or on our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/canairio)

You have **two configuration options or modes** of your CanAirIO device from the app:

## Mobile Station Mode

For record tracks on your device (Sdcard) or publish it to the cloud (share), please follow the next steps:

### Connection to device

<a href="https://github.com/kike-canaries/esp32-hpma115s0/blob/master/images/device_connection.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kike-canaries/esp32-hpma115s0/master/images/device_connection.jpg" width="512" align="center" ></a>

### Recording track and share

**NOTE**: Also all recorded tracks will be saved in the `/sdcard/canairio/` directory on `json` format.

### CanAirIO Mobile Map

We are developing a new mobile map, you can see the current tracks that the people share here:

## Fixed Station Mode

Also, you can connect your CanAirIO device to the WiFi and leave this like a fixed station. In this mode you only need the Android app only for setup the initial settings, after that the device could be publish data without the phone using the WiFi. For this please download the [CanAirIO app](https://bit.ly/3HjDJqP) and setup the WiFi:

### WiFi Setup

  - Open the app and enter on settings section
  - Choose the **Wifi Name** and set the **Password** (if it has) 
  - Save the credentials with the switch.
  - Wait for `connected` status in the summary switch  

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/423856/141445500-ab6d7c6e-4a19-43fc-967e-c33ae60a073d.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/423856/141445500-ab6d7c6e-4a19-43fc-967e-c33ae60a073d.gif" height="250" align="center" ></a>

### Publication

After WiFi is ready, please follow the next steps for publish your fixed station:

  - save Geohash location (turn on the switch for save, it will go to off after some seconds)
  - enable the publication switch
  - wait for some minutes, the device should be show data icon some times
  - your station should be in our [Global Map](canair.io/stations) with the special ID showed in the last item of settings
